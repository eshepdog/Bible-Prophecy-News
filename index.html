Students will continue to build a webpage using elements of HTML and CSS.  We are starting on step 18, page 9, today.  If your code does not end up working, and you have trouble debugging it, you can copy and paste from the documents below (index.txt and javaScript.txt).

Want to learn more HTML on your own?  Here are good places to start:
